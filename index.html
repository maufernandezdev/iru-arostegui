            <p>
                My name is <span>Iru</span> and I'm a <span>UI nerd</span> who loves <span>Design Systems</span> that allow designers and Devs to focus on their <span>work seamlessly</span>.

                <h3>Profesional work</h3>
                <p>Almost all my work is under a Non-disclosure agreement, so I can't show it here. Let's <span>get in touch</span>, and maybe I can walk you through some of it.</p>

                    <h4>Senderos de Raza</h4>
                    <p class="senderos">This is one of the biggest meat companies from Neuquen, Argentina. <br>
                        In this project, we <span>digitalized all of the processes</span>, so we can say that it is a fisical e-commerce.
                        The idea was to eliminate the queue, you can buy it on any digital device, and the product will be delivered to your house or you can pick up what you bought 15 minutes later.</p>

                    <h4>Aislaciones Patagonicas</h4>
                    <p class="aislaciones">This company focused on the manufacture of smart materials for construction, being one of the biggest producers in Argentina.
                        In this case, I only worked on the home and products section.
                        Each product page, the hero images, the panels, and even the icons from the “attributes” menu was fully designed by me, following the look and feel of the brand.</p>

                <h3 class="case-studies-title">case studies</h3>
                <p>By the moment, I only have two case studies, both of which I take very seriously. You can see them in detail here.</p>
